All code initially written in jupyter notebook, and have then been exported to python files. The printouts of the notebook show what the outputs are meant to look like.

folder report-outputs contains all figures created and stored for the report.

folder data-dump contains the video from which we construct our unstructured light-field.

output-dump contains the images with different focused items constructed from our unstructured light field.
